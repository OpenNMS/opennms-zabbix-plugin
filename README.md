# OpenNMS Zabbix Plugin


This plugin was generated by the OIA archetype and is used as example project layout.

The generated plugin contains code examples to demonstrate how to create a:
* Karaf Shell Command (see StatsCommand & TopologyCommand)
* REST Endpoint (see WebhookHandler & WebhookHandlerImpl)
* Event Configuration Extension (see EventConfExtension)
* Alarm Lifecycle Listener (see AlarmForwarder)


Build and install the plugin into your local Maven repository using:
```
mvn clean install
```

> OpenNMS normally runs as root, so make sure the artifacts are installed in `/root/.m2` or try making `/root/.m2` symlink to your user's repository

From the OpenNMS Karaf shell:
```
feature:repo-add mvn:org.opennms.plugins.zabbix/karaf-features/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/xml
feature:install opennms-plugins-zabbix
```

Update automatically:
```
bundle:watch *
```


Once installed, the plugin makes the following Karaf shell commands available:
* opennms-zabbix:stats
* opennms-zabbix:push-topology

You can also access the REST endpoint mounted by the plugin at `http://localhost:8980/opennms/rest/zabbix/ping`
